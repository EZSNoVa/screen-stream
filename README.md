# Screen Stream
A lightweight, simple Rust CLI tool to scream your scream. **WIP**.

### Usage
Stream
```bash
screen-stream.exe start
```

Watch stream
```bash
screen-stream.exe connect {ip}:{port}
```


### Desperation
Out of pure desperation I've created a `package.json` file to be an easier way to run the common commands, I despise JavaScript but only God understands my pain.
